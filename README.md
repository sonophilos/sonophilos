Hi there. I'm sonophilos, a lover of sound.

I am a cofounder of the [ARISE Sound Systems](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/arise-sound-systems-tm-auditory-research-in-sound-enhancement.3379709/) project for software audio modification on rooted Android devices.

I was a developer working on the [Reign of Terror](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/mod-reign-of-terror/35347) mod for Grim Dawn, and was the only active dev for several months.

I compose and produce music. I write lore and poetry. I am avid about many things, but versed with few. I'm here to build skill and experience with what I'm passionate about.
