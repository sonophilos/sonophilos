Hi there. I'm sonophilos, a lover of sound.

I am a cofounder of the ARISE Sound Systems project for software audio modification on rooted Android devices.
I was a developer working on the Reign of Terror mod for Grim Dawn, and was the only active dev for several months.
I compose and produce music. I write lore and poetry. I am avid about many things, but versed with few.
